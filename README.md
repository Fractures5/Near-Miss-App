# Near-miss-App
This repository contains the source code for Near-miss Application 
This application was created in collaboration with workSafe to create an application that will minise accidents in workplace. 

## Project Details
WorkSafe is New Zealand’s primary workplace health and safety regulator, and they work towards preventing harm in workplaces. WorkSafe helps workers return home from their job in a healthy and safe manner. They aim to implement workplace and safety programmes to provide workers with a secure environment to work in.

## Problem Details
The current problem WorkSafe face is in recording near misses, with the major issues following as such:
• Lack of Interest – Currently, workers find recording a near-miss tedious and inefficient. <br>
• Challenging to complete – Currently, workers are unsure how to record a near miss, where to look and what details to register. <br>
• Difficult to acknowledge the importance – Some workers are unsure what a near miss is and are unsure what the significance is. Hence, when a near miss occurs, they ignore it when they should report it as it helps to find and solve problems in the workplace. <br>

## Project Solution
Our team's mission is to deliver a simple yet effective proof-of-concept application that will allow any user to record a near miss and therefore promote a safer work environment. The following are the core features we will implement in the application
• Allow the user to take a photo and annotate it.
• Add a geolocation tag.
• Add a verbal or written note describing the incident.
• The submitted record will be stored on database
